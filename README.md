This project was developed in C++ and implements a custom Stack class (Stack.hpp) with all the typical functionalities of a stack data structure (push, pop, top/peek, size, isEmpty, etc.).
In addition, a Doxyfile is included to automatically generate project documentation using Doxygen, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
